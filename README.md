100 Days Challenge: Cloud Applied Generative AI (TypeScript)

Welcome to my 100 Days Challenge repository for the Cloud Applied Generative AI course! In this repository, I document my journey through the 100-day coding challenge, focusing on TypeScript challenges.

Introduction
This challenge is part of the Cloud Applied Generative AI course, where participants engage in daily coding exercises to enhance their skills in TypeScript programming. I joined this challenge from day 26, as the earlier questions were too easy and I had already completed them.

Repository Structure
Challenges: Contains folders for each day's challenge. Inside each folder, you'll find the challenge description and my solution in TypeScript.
Progress: This directory tracks my progress throughout the challenge. It includes daily logs, reflections, and any additional notes.


Contribution
While this repository primarily serves as my personal progress tracker, contributions and feedback are always welcome! If you have suggestions for improving my solutions or notice any errors, feel free to open an issue or pull request.
